Emilua - Lua execution engine

endif::[]

Emilua provides support for creating actors in isolated processes using Linux
namespaces. The idea is to prevent potentially exploitable code from accessing
resources beyond what has been explicitly handed to them. That's the basis for
capability-based security systems, and it maps pretty well to APIs implementing
the actor model such as Emilua.

.XKCD 1200: Authorization
image::authorization.png["If someone steals my laptop while I'm logged in, they can read my email, take my money, and impersonate me to my friends, but at least they can't install drivers without my permission.",link=https://xkcd.com/1200/]

Even modern operating systems are still somehow rooted in an age where we didn't
know how to properly partition computer resources adequately to user needs
keeping a design focused on practical and conscious security. Several solutions
are stacked together to somehow fill this gap and they usually work for most of
the applications, but that's not all of them.

Consider the web browser. There is an active movement that try to push for a
future where only the web browser exists and users will handle all of their
communications, store & share their photos, book hotels & tickets, check their
medical history, manage their banking accounts, and much more... all without
ever leaving the browser. In such scenario, any protection offered by the OS to
protect programs from each other is rendered useless! Only a single program
exists. If a hacker exploits the right vulnerability, all of the user's data
will be stolen.

The browser is part of a special class of programs. The browser is a shell. A
shell is any interface that acts as a layer between the user and the world. The
web browser is the shell for the www world. Www browser or not, any shell will
face similar problems and has to be consciously designed to safely isolate
contexts that distrust each other. I'm not aware of *anything* better than
FreeBSD's Capsicum to do just this. In the absence of Capsicum, we have Linux
namespaces which can be used to build something close (and that's what browsers
use).

Unfortunately the cost for building such sandboxes is too high, and require
specialized teams of experts. Emilua attempts to democratize this technology by
hiding it behind simple APIs. Right now the API is very crude indeed, but the
support will only improve in future releases.

== The API

[quote,Capsicum: practical capabilities for UNIX, 'Robert N. M. Watson, Jonathan Anderson, Ben Laurie, and Kris Kennaway']
____
Compartmentalised application development is, of necessity, distributed
application development, with software components running in different processes
and communicating via message passing.
____

The Emilua's API to spawn an actor lies within the reach of a simple function
call:

[source,lua]
----
local my_channel = spawn_vm(module)
----

Check the manual elsewhere to understand the details. As for Linux namespaces,
the idea is to spawn an actor where no system resources are available (e.g. the
filesystem is empty, no network interfaces are available, no PIDs from other
processes can be seen, global wide IPC has been unshared, ...).

Consider the hypothetical `sandbox` class:

[source,lua]
----
local mysandbox1 = sandbox.new()
local my_channel = spawn_vm(module, mysandbox1:context())
mysandbox1:handshake()
----

That would be the ideal we're pursuing. Nothing other than 2 extra lines of code
at most under your application. All complexity for creating sandboxes taken care
of by specialized teams of security experts. The Capsicum
paper{_}footnote:[https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/papers/2010usenix-security-capsicum-website.pdf]
released in 2010 analysed and compared different sandboxing technologies and
showed some interesting figures. Consider the following figure that we reproduce
here:

.Sandboxing mechanisms employed by Chromium
|===
|Operating system |Model |Line count |Description

|Windows |ACLs |22350 |Windows ACLs and SIDs
|Linux |`chroot` |605 |`setuid` root helper sandboxes renderer
|Mac OS X |Seatbelt |560 |Path-based MAC sandbox
|Linux |SELinux |200 |Restricted sandbox type enforcement domain
|Linux |`seccomp` |11301 |`seccomp` and userspace syscall wrapper
|FreeBSD |Capsicum |100 |Capsicum sandboxing using `cap_enter`
|===

Do notice that line count is not the only metric of interest. The original paper
accompanies a very interesting discussion detailing applicability, risks, and
levels of security offered by each approach. Just a few years after the paper
was released, user namespaces was merged to Linux and yet a new option for
sandboxing is now available. Within this discussion, we can discard most of the
approaches -- DAC-based, MAC-based, or too intrusive to be even possible to
abstract away as a reusable component -- as inadequate to our endeavour.

Out of them, Capsicum wins hands down. It's just as capable to isolate parts of
an application, but with much less chance to error (for the Chromium patchset,
it was just 100 lines of extra C code after all). Unfortunately, Capsicum is not
available in every modern OS.

Do keep in mind that this is code written by experts in their own fields, and
their salary is nothing less than what Google can afford. 11301 lines of code
written by a team of Google engineers for a lifetime project such as Google
Chromium is not an investment that any project can afford. That's what the
democratization of sandboxing technology needs to do so even small projects can
afford them. That's why it's important to use sound models that are easy to
analyse such as capability-based security systems. That's why it's important to
offer an API that only adds two extra lines of code to your application. That's
the only way to democratize access to such technology.

NOTE: Rust programmers' vision of security is to rewrite the world in Rust, a
rather unfeasible undertaking, and a huge waste of resources. In a similar
fashion, Deno was released to exploit v8 as the basis for its sandboxing
features (now they expect the world to be rewritten in TypeScript). The heart of
Emilua's sandboxing relies on technologies that can isolate any code (e.g. C
libraries to parse media streams).

Back to our API, the hypothetical `sandbox` class that we showed earlier will
have to be some library that abstracts the differences between each sandbox
technology in the different platforms. The API that Emilua actually exposes as
of this release abstracts all of the semantics related to actor messaging,
work/lifetime accounting, process reaping, DoS protection, serialization, lots
of Linux namespaces details (e.g. PID1), and much more, but it still expects you
to actually initialize the sandbox.

== The option `linux_namespaces`

The `spawn_vm()` function will only use Linux namespaces when you pass an
options object that instructs it to use Linux namespaces:

[source,lua]
----
local my_channel = spawn_vm(module, { linux_namespaces = { ... } })
----

The following options are supported for the `linux_namespaces` table:

`new_uts: boolean = false`:: Whether to create the process within a new UTS
namespace.

`new_ipc: boolean = false`:: Whether to create the process within a new IPC
namespace.

`new_pid: boolean = false`::

Whether to create the process within a new PID namespace.

`new_user: boolean = false`:: Whether to create the process within a new
user namespace.

`new_net: boolean = false`:: Whether to create the process within a new net
namespace.

`new_mount: boolean = false`:: Whether to create the process within a new
mount namespace.

`environment: { [string] = string }|nil`:: A table of strings that will be used
as the created process' `envp`. On `nil`, an empty `envp` will be used.

`stdin,stdout,stderr: "share"|file_descriptor|nil`::

`"share"`:::
The spawned process will share the specified standard handle (`stdin`, `stdout`,
or `stderr`) with the caller process.

`file_descriptor`:::
Use the file descriptor as the specified standard handle (`stdin`, `stdout`, or
`stderr`) for the spawned process.

`nil`:::
Create and use a closed pipe end as the specified standard handle (`stdin`,
`stdout`, or `stderr`) for the spawned process.

`init.script: string`:: The source code for a script that is used to initialize
the sandbox in the child process.

`init.fd: file_descriptor`:: A file descriptor that will be sent to the
`init.script`. The script can access this fd through the variable `fdarg` that
is available within the script.

== The `init.script`

Unless you execute the process as root, Linux will deny the creation of all
namespaces except for the user namespace. The user namespace is the only
namespace that an unprivileged process can create. However it's fine to pair the
user namespace with any combination of the other ones. Let's start by isolating
the network resources as that's the easiest one:

[source,lua]
----
spawn_vm('', {
    linux_namespaces = {
        new_user = true,
        new_net = true
    }
})
----

The process will be created within a new network namespace where no interfaces
besides the loopback device exist. And even the loopback device will be down! If
you want to configure the loopback device so the process can at least bind
sockets to it you can use the program `ip`. However the program `ip` needs to
run within the new namespace. To spawn the program `ip` within the namespace of
the new actor you need to acquire the file descriptors to its namespaces. There
are two ways to do that. You can either use race-prone PID primitives (easy), or
you can use a handshake protocol to ensure that there are no races related to
PID dances. Below we show the race-free method.

[source,lua]
----
local init_script = [[
    local userns = C.open('/proc/self/ns/user', C.O_RDONLY)
    send_with_fd(fdarg, '.', userns)
    local netns = C.open('/proc/self/ns/net', C.O_RDONLY)
    send_with_fd(fdarg, '.', netns)

    -- sync point
    C.read(fdarg, 1)
]]

local shost, sguest = unix.seqpacket_socket.pair()
sguest = sguest:release()

spawn_vm('', {
    linux_namespaces = {
        new_user = true,
        new_net = true,
        init = { script = init_script, fd = sguest }
    }
})
sguest:close()
local ignored_buf = byte_span.new(1)
local userns = ({shost:receive_with_fds(ignored_buf, 1)})[2][1]
local netns = ({shost:receive_with_fds(ignored_buf, 1)})[2][1]
system.spawn{
    program = 'ip',
    arguments = {'ip', 'link', 'set', 'dev', 'lo', 'up'},
    nsenter_user = userns,
    nsenter_net = netns
}:wait()
shost:close()
----

An `AF_UNIX`+`SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket is used to coordinate the parent and the
child processes. This type of socket allows duplex communication between two
parties with builtin framing for messages, disconnection detection (process
reference counting if you will), and it also allows sending file descriptors
back-and-forth.

[NOTE]
.`errexit`
====
We don't want to accidentally ignore errors from the C API exposed to the
`init.script`. That's why we borrow an idea from BASH. One common folklore among
BASH programmers is the unofficial strict mode. Among other things, this mode
dictates the use of BASH's `set -o errexit`.

And `errexit` exists for the `init.script` as well. For `init.script`, `errexit`
is just a global boolean. Every time the C API fails, the Emilua wrapper for the
function will check its value. On `errexit=true` (the default when the script
starts), the process will abort whenever some C API fails. That's specially
important when you're using the API to drop process credentials/rights.
====

We also close `sguest` from the host side as soon as we're done with it. This
will ensure any operation on `shost` will fail if the child process aborts for
any reason (i.e. no deadlocks happen here).

If you for any reason absolutely need to use race-prone PID dances, you can
access its numeric value by:

[source,lua]
----
local my_channel = spawn_vm(...)
print(my_channel.child_pid)
----

Do keep in mind that process reaping happens automatically and the PID won't
remain reserved once the child dies, so it's racy to use the PID. Even if
process reaping was *not* automatic, it'd still be possible to have races if the
parent died while some other process was using this PID. Use `child_pid` only as
a last resort.

[NOTE]
.The PID-dance race illustrated
====
One prevailing command in Linux distros today to assign an UID range to
unprivileged processes is the suid binary `newuidmap`. `newuidmap` receives the
target's PID as its first argument. The following can be used to make use of
``newuidmap``'s powers within your program (check the manpage on newuidmap(1) to
understand the details):

[source,lua]
----
system.spawn{
    program = 'newuidmap',
    stdout = 'share',
    stderr = 'share',
    arguments = {
        'newuidmap',
        tostring(my_channel.child_pid),
        '0', '100000', '1001'
    }
}:wait()
----

Unfortunately this idiom is race-prone. The PID of any target process is only
reserved until the parent process reaps it. If your program (and
`my_channel.child_pid` as well) dies right before `newuidmap` starts to do its
job, `my_channel.child_pid` could be recycled to an unrelated process.

This race is very unlikely to happen and not really dangerous on many use-cases,
but you should be aware of its existence. The same would apply to any PID dance
involving other tools (such as `ip-netns`).
====

TIP: You can use the same techniques taught here to initialize the UID/GID
mapping for the user namespace.

== The PID namespace

When a new PID namespace is created, the process inside the new namespace ceases
to see processes from the parent namespace. Your process still can see new
processes created in the child's namespace, so invisibility only happens in one
direction. PID namespaces are hierarchically nested in parent-child
relationships.

The first process in a PID namespace is PID1 within that namespace. PID1 has a
few special responsibilities. After the `init.script` exits, the Emilua runtime
will fork if it's running as PID1. This new child will assume the role of
starting your module (the Lua VM). The PID1 process will perform the following
jobs:

* Forward `SIGTERM`, `SIGUSR1`, `SIGUSR2`, `SIGHUP`, and `SIGINT` to the
  child. There is no point in re-routing every signal, but more may be added to
  this set if you present a compelling case.
* Reap zombie processes.
* Exit when the child dies with the same exit code as the child's.

[TIP]
.The controlling terminal
====
The Emilua runtime won't call `setsid()` nor `setpgid()` by itself, so the
process will stay in the same session as its parent, and it'll have access to
the same controlling terminal.

If you want to block the new actor from accessing the controlling terminal, you
may perform the usual calls in `init.script`:

[source,lua]
----
setsid()
setpgid(0, 0)
----

On the other hand, if you want to set up a pty in `init.script`, the PID1 will
be the session leader which also happens to be a good default on this case. That
way, the actor running in PID2 wouldn't accidentally acquire a new ctty if it
happens to `open()` a tty that isn't currently controlling any session.
====

If the PID1 dies, all processes from that namespace (including further
descendant PID namespaces) will be killed. This behavior allows you to fully
dispose of a container when no longer needed by sending `SIGKILL` to PID1. No
process will escape.

Communication topology may be arbitrarily defined as per the actor model, but
the processes always assume a topology of a tree (supervision trees), and no PID
namespace ever “re-parents”.

The Emilua runtime automatically sends `SIGKILL` to every process spawned using
the Linux namespaces API when the actor that spawned them exits. If you want
fine control over these processes, you can use a few extra methods that are
available to the channel object that represents them.

=== `detach(self)`

Detaches the calling VM/actor from the role of supervisor for the process/actor
represented by `self`. After this operation is done, the process/actor
represented by `self` is allowed to outlive the calling process.

NOTE: This method will fail for channels received through `inbox`.

=== `kill(self, signo: integer|nil = system.signal.SIGKILL)`

Sends `signo` to the process. On `SIGKILL`, it'll also close the channel.

NOTE: This method will fail for channels received through `inbox`.

NOTE: A PID file descriptor is used to send `signo` so no races involving PID
numbers ever happen.

== The mount namespace

Let's build up on our previous knowledge and build a sandbox with an empty `"/"`
(that's right!).

[source,lua]
----
local init_script = [[
    ...

    -- unshare propagation events
    C.mount(nil, '/', nil, C.MS_PRIVATE)

    C.umask(0)
    C.mount(nil, '/mnt', 'tmpfs', 0)
    C.mkdir('/mnt/proc', mode(7, 5, 5))
    C.mount(nil, '/mnt/proc', 'proc', 0)
    C.mkdir('/mnt/tmp', mode(7, 7, 7))

    -- pivot root
    C.mkdir('/mnt/mnt', mode(7, 5, 5))
    C.chdir('/mnt')
    C.pivot_root('.', '/mnt/mnt')
    C.chroot('.')
    C.umount2('/mnt', C.MNT_DETACH)

    -- sync point
    C.read(fdarg, 1)
]]

spawn_vm('', {
    linux_namespaces = {
        ...,
        new_mount = true,

        -- let's go ahead and create a new
        -- PID namespace as well
        new_pid = true
    }
})
----

We could certainly create a better initial `"/"`. We could certainly do away
with a few of the lines by cleverly reordering them. However the example is
still nice to just illustrate a few of the syscalls exposed to the Lua
script. There's nothing particularly hard about mount namespaces. We just call a
few syscalls, and no fd-dance between host and guest is really necessary.

[TIP]
====
Even if it's a sandbox, and root inside the sandbox doesn't mean root outside
it, maybe you still want to drop all root privileges at the end of the
`init.script`:

[source,lua]
----
C.cap_set_proc('=')
----

It won't be particularly useful for most people, but that technique is still
useful to -- for instance -- create alternative LXC/FlatPak front-ends to run a
few programs (if the program can't update its own binary files, new
possibilities for sandboxing practice open up).
====

One technique that we should mention is how `module` in `spawn_vm(module)` is
interpreted when you use Linux namespaces. This argument no longer means an
actual module when namespaces are involved. It'll just be passed along to the
new process. The following snippet shows you how to actually get the new actor
in the container by finding a proper module to start.

[source,lua]
----
local guest_code = [[
    local inbox = require 'inbox'
    local ip = require 'ip'

    local ch = inbox:receive().dest
    ch:send(ip.host_name())
]]

local init_script = [[
    ...

    local modulefd = C.open(
        '/app.lua',
        bit.bor(C.O_WRONLY, C.O_CREAT),
        mode(6, 0, 0))
    send_with_fd(fdarg, '.', modulefd)
]]

local my_channel = spawn_vm('/app.lua', ...)

...

local module = ({shost:receive_with_fds(ignored_buf, 1)})[2][1]
module = file.stream.new(module)
stream.write_all(module, guest_code)
shost:close()

my_channel:send{ dest = inbox }
print(inbox:receive())
----

There's a lot to comment on here. First: this setup is still hard! That's no way
a democratization of the sandboxing technology that was promised in the
beginning of this text. However, do keep in mind that all of this is just for
setup and almost all of that can be abstracted away in a library. Once all that
is abstracted away, pay attention to all benefits you get:

* The channel API from the actor model work just the same. Arbitrary topology,
  work-counting tracking to abort a read operation when supervisor subtrees die
  and some process becomes unreachable, object serialization, and plenty
  more. All that works per usual.
* The only resources a process has access to are the resources that are
  explicitly given to it. Pay close attention that the child process couldn't
  even send its host name back to the parent without the parent first sending
  its address over. The parent could just as well create another actor to just
  supervise this sandbox and not send its address directly. All usual properties
  from capability-based security systems follow.
* The system is dynamic and now you can create new sandboxes on demand (think of
  each sandbox as a new user in the system isolated from each other). For a web
  browser, one valid strategy would be to spawn a sandbox for each tab in the
  UI. That's one property not easily achievable (or even possible) with many of
  the security solutions that are common today (e.g. SELinux). Please read the
  Capsicum paper to get more on this point.
* Should the need arise, you retain low level controls over the container
  setup. That should give the API applicability beyond application
  compartmentalisation.  Now you can build your own front-ends for the
  application trees shared by FlatPak, LXC, and other container projects.

Now to the problems: as it stands, it's impossible to build automatic support to
share modules between the host and the sandboxes. The Capsicum project faced a
similar problem in C and had to customize the loader. A library cannot abstract
this problem. The Emilua project needs a package manager to tackle it, and that
will be one of its next milestones. Once we're there, then the promise of
democratizing this technology could be fulfilled.

== Implementation details

NOTE: The purpose of this section is to help you attack the system. If you're
trying to find security holes, this section should be a good overview on how the
whole system works.

If you find any bug in the code, please responsibly send a bug report so the
Emilua team can fix it.

=== Message serialization

Emilua follows the advice from WireGuard developers to avoid parsing bugs by
avoiding object serialization altogether. Sequenced-packet sockets with builtin
framing are used so we always receive/send whole messages in one API call.

There is a hard-limit (configurable at build time) on the maximum number of
members you can send per message. This limit would need to exist anyway to avoid
DoS from bad clients.

Another limitation is that no nesting is allowed. You can either send a single
non-nil value or a non-empty dictionary where every member in it is a leaf from
the root tree. The messaging API is part of the attack surface that bad clients
can exploit. We cannot afford a single bug here, so the code must be simple. By
forbidding subtrees we can ignore recursion complexities and simplify the code a
lot.

The struct used to receive messages follows:

[source,c]
----
enum kind
{
    boolean_true    = 1,
    boolean_false   = 2,
    string          = 3,
    file_descriptor = 4,
    actor_address   = 5,
    nil             = 6
};

struct linux_container_message
{
    union
    {
        double as_double;
        uint64_t as_int;
    } members[EMILUA_CONFIG_LINUX_NAMESPACES_MESSAGE_MAX_MEMBERS_NUMBER];
    unsigned char strbuf[
        EMILUA_CONFIG_LINUX_NAMESPACES_MESSAGE_SIZE - sizeof(members)];

A variant class is needed to send the messages. Given a variant is needed
anyway, we just adopt NaN-tagging for its implementation as that will make the
struct members packed together and no memory from the host process hidden among
paddings will leak to the containers.

The code assumes that no signaling NaNs are ever produced by the Lua VM to
simplify the NaN-tagging
scheme{_}footnote:[http://www.lua.org/source/5.2/lapi.c.html#lua_pushnumber]footnote:[https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/blob/v2.0.5/src/lj_api.c#L569]. The
type is stored in the mantissa bits of a signaling NaN.

If the first member is nil, then we have a non-dictionary value stored in
`members[1]`. Otherwise, a `nil` will act as a sentinel to the end of the
dictionary. No sentinel will exist when the dictionary is fully filled.

`read()` calls will write to objects of this type directly (i.e. no intermediate
`char[N]` buffer is used) so we avoid any complexity with code related to
alignment adjustments.

`memset(buf, 0, s)` is used to clear any unused member of the struct before a
call to `write()` so we avoid leaking memory from the process to any container.

Strings are preceded by a single byte that contains the size of the string that
follows. Therefore, strings are limited to 255 characters. Following from this
scheme, a buffer sufficiently large to hold the largest message is declared to
avoid any buffer overflow. However, we still perform bounds checking to make
sure no uninitialized data from the code stack is propagated back to Lua code to
avoid leaking any memory. The bounds checking function in the code has a simple
implementation that doesn't make the code much more complex and it's easy to
follow.

To send file descriptors over, `SCM_RIGHTS` is used. There are a lot of quirks
involved with `SCM_RIGHTS` (e.g. extra file descriptors could be stuffed into
the buffer even if you didn't expect them). The encoding scheme for the network
buffer is far simpler to use than ``SCM_RIGHTS``' ancillary
data. Complexity-wise, there's far greater chance to introduce a bug in code
related to `SCM_RIGHTS` than a bug in the code that parses the network buffer.

Code could be simpler if we only supported messaging strings over, but that
would just defer the problem of secure serialization on the user's back. Code
should be simple, but not simpler. By throwing all complexity on the user's
back, the implementation would offer no security. At least we centralized the
sensitive object serialization so only one block of code need to be reviewed and
audited.

=== Spawning a new process

UNIX systems allow the userspace to spawn new processes by a `fork()` followed
by an `exec()`. `exec()` really means an executable will be available in the
container, but this assumption doesn't play nice with our idea of spawning new
actors in an empty container.

What we really want is to to perform a fork followed by *no* `exec()` call. This
approach in itself also has its own problems. `exec()` is the only call that
will flush the address space of the running process. If we don't `exec()` then
the new process that was supposed to run untrusted code with no access to system
resources will be able to read all previous memory -- memory that will most
likely contain sensitive information that we didn't want leaked. Other problems
such as threads (supported by the Emilua runtime) would also hinder our ability
to use `fork()` without ``exec()``ing.

One simple approach to solve all these problems is to `fork()` at the beginning
of the program so we `fork()` before any sensitive information is loaded in the
process' memory. Forking at a well known point also brings other benefits. We
know that no thread has been created yet, so resources such as locks and the
global memory allocator stay in a well defined state. By creating this extra
process before much more extra virtual memory or file descriptor slots in our
process table have been requested, we also make sure that further processes
creation will be cheaper.

----

Every time the main process wants to create an actor in a new process, it'll
defer its job onto the supervisor that was ``fork()``ed near `main()`. An
`AF_UNIX`+`SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket is used to orchestrate this process. Given the
supervisor is only used to create new processes, it can use blocking APIs that
will simplify the code a lot. The blocking `read()` on the socket also means
that it won't be draining any CPU resources when it's not needed. Also important
is the threat model here. The main process is not trying to attack the
supervisor process. The supervisor is also trusted and it doesn't need to run
inside a container. `SCM_RIGHTS` handling between the main process and the
supervisor is simplified a lot due to these constraints.

However some care is still needed to setup the supervisor. Each actor will
initially be an exact copy of the supervisor process memory and we want to make
sure that no sensitive data is leaked there. The first thing we do right after
creating the supervisor is collecting any sensitive information that might still
exist in the main process (e.g. `argv` and `envp`) and instructing the
supervisor process to `explicit_bzero()` them. This compromise is not as good as
`exec()` would offer, but it's the best we can do while we limit ourselves to
reasonably portable C code with few assumptions about dynamic/static linkage
against system libraries, and other settings from the host environment.

This problem doesn't end here. Now that we assume the process memory from the
supervisor contains *no* sensitive data, we want to keep it that way. It may be
true that every container is assumed as a container that some hacker already
took over (that's why we're isolating them, after all), but one container
shouldn't leak information to another one. In other words, we don't even want to
load sensitive information regarding the setup of any container from the
supervisor process as that could leak into future containers. The solution here
is to serialize such information (e.g. the `init.script`) such that it is only
sent directly to the final process. Another `AF_UNIX`+`SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket is
used.

Now to the assumptions on the container process. We do assume that it'll run
code that is potentially dangerous and some hacker might own the container at
some point. However the initial setup does *not* run arbitrary dangerous code
and it still is part of the trusted computing base. The problem is that we don't
know whether the `init.script` will need to load sensitive information at any
point to perform its job. That's why we setup the Lua VM that runs `init.script`
to use a custom allocator that will `explicit_bzero()` all allocated memory at
the end. Allocations done by external libraries such as libcap lie outside of
our control, but they rarely matter anyway.

That's mostly the bulk of our problems and how we handle them. Other problems
are summarized in the short list below.

* `SIGCHLD` would be sent to the main process, but we cannot install arbitrary
  signal handlers in the main process as that's a property from the application
  (i.e. signal handling disposition is not a resource owned by the Emilua
  runtime). The problem was already solved by making the actor a child of the
  supervisor process.
* We can't install arbitrary signal handlers in the container process either as
  that would break every module by bringing different semantics depending on the
  context where it runs (host/container). To handle PID1 automatically we just
  fork a new process and forward its signals to the new child.
* https://lwn.net/Articles/781013/[`"/proc/self/exe"` is a resource inherited
  from the main process (i.e. a resource that exists outside the container, so
  the container is not existing in a completely empty world), and could be
  exploited in the container]. `ETXTBSY` will hinder the ability from the
  container to meddle with `"/proc/self/exe"`, and `ETXTBSY` is guaranteed by
  the existence of the supervisor process (even if the main process exits, the
  supervisor will stay alive).

The output from tools such as `top` start to become rather cool when you play
with nested containers:

=== Work lifetime management

PID1 eases our life a lot. As soon as any container starts to act suspiciously
we can safely kill the whole subtree of processes by sending `SIGKILL` to the
PID1 that started it.

`AF_UNIX`+`SOCK_SEQPACKET` sockets are connection-oriented and simplify our work
even further. We `shutdown()` the ends of each pair such that they'll act
unidirectionally just like pipes. When all copies of one end die, the operation
on the other end will abort. The actor API translates to MPSC channels, so we
never ever send the reading end to any container (we only make copies of the
sending end). The kernel will take care of any tricky reference counting
necessary (and ``SIGKILL``ing PID1 will make sure no unwanted end survives).

The only work left for us to do is pretty much to just orchestrate the internal
concurrency architecture of the runtime (e.g. watch out for blocking
reads). Given that we want to abort reads when all the copies of the sending end
are destroyed, we don't keep any copy to the sending end in our own
process. Everytime we need to send our address over, we create a new pair of
sockets to send the newly created sending end over. `inbox` will unify the
receipt of messages coming from any of these sockets. You can think of each
newly created socket as a new capability. If one capability is revoked, others
remain unaffected.

One good actor could send our address further to a bad actor, and there is no
way to revoke access to the bad actor without also revoking access to the good
actor, but that is in line with capability-based security systems. Access rights
are transitive. In fact, a bad actor could write 0-sized messages over the
`AF_UNIX`+`SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket to trick us into thinking the channel was
already closed. We'll happily close the channel and there is no problem
here. The system can happily recover later on (and only this capability is
revoked anyway).

=== Flow control

The runtime doesn't schedule any read on the socket unless the user calls
`inbox:receive()`. Upon reading a new message the runtime will either wake the
receiving fiber directly, or enqueue the result in a buffer if no receiving
fiber exists at the time (this can happen if the user interrupted the fiber, or
another result arrived and woke the fiber up already). `inbox:receive()` won't
schedule any read on the socket if there's some result already enqueued in the
buffer.

=== `setns(fd, CLONE_NEWPID)`

We don't offer any helper to spawn a program (i.e. `system.spawn()`) within an
existing PID namespace. That's intentional (although one could still do it
through `init.script`). `setns(fd, CLONE_NEWPID)` is dangerous. Only `exec()`
will flush the address space for the process. The window of time that exists
until `exec()` is called means that any memory from the previous process could
be read by a compromised container (cf. ptrace(2)).

=== Tests

A mix of approaches is used to test the implementation.

There's an unit test for every class of good inputs. There are unit tests for
accidental bad inputs that one might try to perform through the Lua API. The
unit tests always try to create one scenario for buffered messages and another
for immediate delivery of the result.

When support for plugins is enabled, fuzz tests are built as well. The fuzzers
are generation-based. One fuzzer will generate good input and test if the
program will accept all of them. Another fuzzer will mutate a good input into a
bad one (e.g. truncate the message size to attempt a buffer overflow), and check
if the program rejects all of them.

There are some other tests as well (e.g. ensure no padding exists between the
members of the C struct we send over the wire).

=== Helpers

==== `mode(user: integer, group: integer, other: integer) -> integer`

[source,lua]
----
function mode(user, group, other)
    return bit.bor(bit.lshift(user, 6), bit.lshift(group, 3), other)
end
----

==== `receive_with_fd(fd: integer, buf_size: integer) -> string, integer, integer`

Returns three values:

1. String with the received message (or `nil` on error).
2. File descriptor received (or `-1` on none).
3. The errno value (or `0` on success).

==== `send_with_fd(fd: integer, str: buffer, fd2: integer) -> integer, integer`

Returns two values:

1. `sendmsg()` return.
2. The errno value (or `0` on success).

=== Functions

These functions live inside the global table `C`. `errno` (or `0` on success) is
returned as the second result.

* `read()`. Opposed to the C function, it receives two arguments. The second
  argument is the size of the buffer. The buffer is allocated automatically, and
  returned as a string in the first result (unless an error happens, then `nil`
  is returned).
* `write()`. Opposed to the C function, it receives two arguments. The second
  one is a string which will be used as the buffer.
* `sethostname()`. Opposed to the C function, it only receives the string
  argument.
* `setdomainname()`. Opposed to the C function, it only receives the string
  argument.
* `setgroups()`. Opposed to the C function, it receives a list of numbers as its
  single argument.
* `cap_set_proc()`. Opposed to the C function, it receives a string as its
  single argument. The string is converted to the `cap_t` type using the
  function `cap_from_text()`.
* `cap_drop_bound()`. Opposed to the C function, it receives a string as its
  single argument. The string is converted to the `cap_value_t` type using the
  function `cap_from_name()`.
* `cap_set_ambient()`. Opposed to the C function, it receives a string as its
  first argument. The string is converted to the `cap_value_t` type using the
  function `cap_from_name()`. The second parameter is a boolean.
* `execve()`. Opposed to the C function, `argv` and `envp` are specified as a
  Lua table.
* `fexecve()`. Opposed to the C function, `argv` and `envp` are specified as a
  Lua table.

Other exported functions work as usual (except that `errno` or `0` is returned
as the second result):

* `open()`.
* `mkdir()`.
* `chdir()`.
* `umask()`.
* `mount()`.
* `umount()`.
* `umount2()`.
* `pivot_root()`.
* `chroot()`.
